    <para>The deldim operator deletes the left-most dimension from the array.
    The to-be-deleted dimension must have size = 1. See the adddim operator
    reference page for an example of creating a dimension of size = 1.</para>

    <para>You can use the deldim operator in the FROM clause of an AQL SELECT
    statement, as a stand-alone operator in a AFL statement, or as an operand
    within other SciDB operators.</para>
