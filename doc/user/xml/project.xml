    <title>Summary</title>

    <para>The project operator produces a result array that includes some
    attributes of a source array but excludes others. You indicate which
    attributes to include by supplying their names with the attribute
    parameter(s). In the result array, the attributes will appear in the order
    you name them as parameters.</para>

    <para>You can use the project operator in the FROM clause of an AQL SELECT
    statement, as a stand-alone operator in a AFL statement, or as an operand
    within other SciDB operators.</para>

    <informalexample>
      <para>This example takes a 2-D array with 3 attributes, excludes one of
      the attributes, and reorders the remaining two.</para>
