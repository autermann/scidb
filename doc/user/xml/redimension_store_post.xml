    <title>Summary</title>

    <para>The redimension_store operator produces a stored result array using
    data from a source array.</para>

    <para>When you use redimension_store, you must decide two things:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>How will the variables of the source array appear in the target
        array?</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>How will cell collisions be handled?</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>For each variable of the source array, you have these choices for
    how to use it in the target array:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Include the variable without modification (i.e., an attribute
        remains an attribute and a dimension remains a dimension).</para>

        <para>To include an attribute without modification, simply include in
        the schema definition of the target array an attribute of the same
        data type with the same name. The analogous rule holds for including
        dimensions without modification.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Include the variable, but convert it (from an attribute to a
        dimension or vice versa)</para>

        <para>To convert an attribute to a dimension, simply include in the
        schema definition for the target array a dimension with the same name
        and datatype as the attribute from the source array. The analogous
        process holds for converting dimensions to attributes.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Exclude the variable</para>

        <para>To exclude a variable, simply omit it from the schema definition
        of the target array. Even if you exclude a variable, its data can
        still contribute to the target array through aggregates.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Note that a single use of the redimension_store operator can make
    all of the above kinds of modifications to the various variables in the
    source array.</para>

    <para>Depending on how you arrange the source array's variables in the
    target array, the redimension_store operator might encounter cell
    collisions. A cell collision occurs when the redimension_store operator
    generates multiple candidate cells for a single cell location of the
    target array.</para>

    <para>There are several ways to handle cell collisions. The most
    straightforward is to retain an entire vector of candidate cells along an
    auxilliary dimension sometiems called a "synthetic dimension." the
    synthetic dimension must be declared in the target schema and its data
    type must be int64.</para>

    <para>If you do not use a synthetic dimension and the redimension_store
    operator produces a collision at a cell location, SciDB will produce a
    single cell from all of the candidate cells. The attributes of that cell
    in the target array will be populated as follows:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>If the target attribute was declared as the value of an
        aggregate function, the value will be the value of that function
        calculated over the set of candidate cells for that cell location. For
        each aggregate you calculate, a nullable attribute to accommodate it
        must exist in the target array's schema. the attribute must have the
        appropriate datatype for that aggregate function.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>If the target attribute is simply the value of an attribute from
        the source array (rather than an aggregate function), the value of the
        target attribute will be from an arbitrarily chosen candidate cell for
        that location. If there are several such attributes in the target
        array, their values will all come from the same candidate cell.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>The argument <replaceable>named_target_array</replaceable> must be
    an array that was previously created in SciDB. The target array's schema
    must accommodate the output of the redimension_store operator.
    Specifically:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>If a variable in the source array appears in the target array,
        the two variables must match in name and data type.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>If the redimension_store operator uses an aggregate, an
        attribute for that aggregate value must exist in the target array. The
        attribute must allow nulls and must be of the appropriate datatype for
        that aggregate function.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>If the target array includes a synthetic dimension, the datatype
        of that dimension must be int64.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The target array cannot include any other variables besides
        variables that appear in the source array, attributes to accommodate
        aggregate values, and one synthetic dimension.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>The target array can include a synthetic dimension OR a set of
        attributes for aggregate values, but not both. In other words, you can
        choose to handle collisions by calculating aggregates or by
        maintaining a vector with all the candidate cell values for each cell
        location, but not both.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>If cell collisions occur, but the target array includes neither a
    synthetic dimension nor aggregates, SciDB will arbitrarily choose a cell
    from the set of candidate cells.</para>

      <para>This example shows a collision-handling strategy in which the
      target array includes some attributes with values from an arbitrarily
      chosen candidate cell and other attributes whose values are aggregates
      calculated over the set of candidate cells.</para>

          <para>Create an array to be the target of the redimension_store
          operator. Note that the array excludes one attribute (a) from the
          source array, includes two other attributes (b and c), and declares
          another attribute (avgD) to accommodate the value of an aggregate.
          Notice also that the target array excludes one of the dimensions
          (givenName) of the source array, so the redimension_store operator
          will generate collisions.<para><programlisting>AQL% <command>CREATE ARRAY</command> namesRedimensioned

          collisions.</para></para>
