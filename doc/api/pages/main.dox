\section intro_sec About documentation
    This documentation is generated via doxygen. We hope it helps you to understand internals of SciDB and get some explanation
    of classes, methods, parameters, etc. We understand that it's not ideal and if you point us for bad descriptions or tell us
    what you would like to see more well documented it really helps us and point the direction of improvements.
