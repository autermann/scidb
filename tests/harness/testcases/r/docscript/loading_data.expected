csv2scidb: Utility for conversion of CSV file to SciDB input text format
	Usage: csv2scidb [options] [ < input-file ] [ > output-file ]
	Default: -f 0 -c 1000000 -q
	Options:
	  -v version of utility
	  -i PATH	input file
	  -o PATH	output file
	  -a PATH	appended output file
	  -c INT	length of chunk
	  -f INT	starting coordinate
	  -n INT	number of instances
	  -d char	delimiter - default ,
	  -p STR	type pattern - N number, S string, s nullable-string, 
	     C char, c nullable-char
	  -q Quote the input line exactly, simply wrap it in ()
	  -s N	skip N lines at the beginning of the file
	  -h 	prints this helpful error message
	 You cannot specify both -q and a set of -p options.
