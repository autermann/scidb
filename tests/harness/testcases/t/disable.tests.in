#
# keep this file sorted to avoid accidental merges of duplicate lines, each part has its
# own sort rules
#

# PART I
#
# THIS PART SHOULD BE FOR TESTS THAT ARE NORMALLY DISABLED, not disabled due to bug/ticket
# e.g. they take too long to run under any supported Cdash config, they are for design or TDD
#   and the code that runs them will fail, etc
#
# - it is best practice if long tests are pushed to a "long" or "slow" subdirectory of the other
#   related tests that are not, for example, scalapack/64instance is of this type
# - it is best practice to give a line explaining why disabled, so others can validate
#   that it is appropriate that they are disabled (and not just leftover from before we started
#   adding ticket numbers for disabled-due-to-failure)
#
#  KEEP THIS IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER

# PART II
# THIS PART IS FOR FAILING TESTS.  These represent known defects in the code or in the tests
# - each disabled test must have a corresponding ticket number
# - TODO: DAVE, please decide whether you would like this sorted
#         A) alpabetical, so that each test is surely added only once OR
#         B) in ticket order
#         as right now it seems random and is inconsistent between disable{,1i}.tests.in
